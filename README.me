An advanced buzzer in node.js for multiple teams.

Each team can use a smartphone, placed on the team's table. Team members can buzz by hitting their table (which is detected by the accelerometer). When someone buzzes, a countdown is shown on all participating devices. A central monitor can show who buzzed and the countdown.
